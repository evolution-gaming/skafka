Scala wrapper for [kafka-clients v3.4.0](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.kafka/kafka-clients/3.4.0)

## Motivation

Kafka provides an official Java client out of the box, which could be used from
Scala code without any additional modifications.

The main disadvantage of using an official client directly is that it implies
a very specific threading model to the application. I.e. the consumer is not
thread safe and also expects a rebalance listener to do the operations in the
same thread.

This makes wrapping a client with [Cats Effect](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/)
classes a bit more complicated than just calling `IO { consumer.poll() }` unless
this is the only call, which is expected to be used.

Skafka does exactly that: a very thin wrapper over official Kafka client to
provide a ready-made Cats Effect API and handle some corner cases concerning
[ConsumerRebalanceListener](https://kafka.apache.org/34/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/clients/consumer/ConsumerRebalanceListener.html) calls.

Comparing to more full-featured libraries such as
[FS2 Kafka](https://fd4s.github.io/fs2-kafka), it might be a little bit more
reliable, because there is little code/logic to do hide the accidenital bugs in.

To summarize:
1. If it suits your goals (i.e. you only ever need to do `consumer.poll()`
without acting on rebalance etc.) then using an official Kafka client directly,
optionally, wrapping all the calls with `cats.effect.IO` is a totally fine idea.
2. If more complicated integration to Cats Effect is required, i.e.
_ConsumerRebalanceListener_ is going to be used then consider using _Skafka_.
3. If streaming with [FS2](https://fs2.io) is required or any other features
the library provides then _FS2 Kafka_ could be a good choice. Note, that it is
less trivial then _Skafka_ and may contain more bugs on top of the official
Kafka client.

## Key features

1. It provides null-less Scala apis for [Producer](skafka/src/main/scala/com/evolutiongaming/skafka/producer/Producer.scala) & [Consumer](skafka/src/main/scala/com/evolutiongaming/skafka/consumer/Consumer.scala)

2. Makes it easy to use your effect monad with help of [cats-effect](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/)

3. Blocking calls are being executed on provided `ExecutionContext`.

4. Simple `case class` based configuration

5. Support of [typesafe config](https://github.com/lightbend/config)    


## Producer usage example

```scala
val producer = Producer.of[IO](config, ecBlocking)
val metadata: IO[RecordMetadata] = producer.use { producer =>
  val record = ProducerRecord(topic = "topic", key = "key", value = "value") 
  producer.send(record).flatten 
}
```

## Consumer usage example

```scala
val consumer = Consumer.of[IO, String, String](config, ecBlocking)
val records: IO[ConsumerRecords[String, String]] = consumer.use { consumer => 
  for {
    _       <- consumer.subscribe(Nel("topic"), None)
    records <- consumer.poll(100.millis)
  } yield records 
}
```

## Setup

```scala
addSbtPlugin("com.evolution" % "sbt-artifactory-plugin" % "0.0.2")

libraryDependencies += "com.evolutiongaming" %% "skafka" % "15.0.0"
``` 

## Notes

While _Skafka_ provides an ability to use `ConsumerRebalanceListener`
functionality, not all of the method calls are supported.

See the following PRs for more details:
https://github.com/evolution-gaming/skafka/pull/150
https://github.com/evolution-gaming/skafka/pull/122

To our latest knowledge neither `FS2 Kafka` supports all of the
methods / functionality.
